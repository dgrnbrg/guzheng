# guzheng

guzheng is a library for instrumenting clojure code. It's named after the eponymous traditional chinese instrument.

## Usage

Read a clojure file into a string. Then, use the instrument function. The instrument function
takes a String to instrument and an instrumentation function. Since it's annoying to get that String,
consider instrument-ns or instrument-nses to resolve an ns to source code automatically.
