# guzheng

guzheng is a library for doing branch coverage analysis of clojure code. It's named after
the eponymous traditional chinese instrument. You'll want to use the lein-guzheng plugin
rather than invoking guzheng directly, unless you're doing something really exotic.

## Usage

See the subfolder containing lein-guzheng for details on how to invoke the guzheng plugin.

guzheng now uses ztellman/sleight to instrument clojure code. See @ztellman's repository for details of sleight.
